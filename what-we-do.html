            <p>What we do at Nielsen Zehe & Antas PC is prevent our clientâ€™s problems in some cases, solve their problems in other cases, and ultimately, is the problems cannot be prevented or solved, prepare to take the problems to trial and WIN. Our attorneys, who view themselves as problem solvers, have tried more cases to a jury or judge that most law firms collectively. Whether the problem is a lawsuit, business deal, or formation of a new business, we have the skill, experience and business acumen to help our clients. </p>
